## Install

```sh
# yarn
yarn add --dev monosize

# npm
npm install --save-dev monosize
```

## Usage

> Note: `monosize` requires building packages first before doing any kind of measurements. Make sure to accommodate this in your pipeline

### Fixtures

Fixtures declare exports that should be measured by the `monosize` tool. Fixtures are created inside each package.

For example:

```js
import { Component } from '@library/component';

export { Component };
// üëÜ "export" is required to be able to measure the size of the component

export default {
  name: 'Component',
  // üëÜ defines a name for a fixture that will be used in output
};
```

## Configuration

You need to create a `monosize.config.mjs` in the root of your project directory (next to `package.json`) to configure storage and bundler adapters.

```
my-proj/
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ monosize.config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îú‚îÄ bundle-size/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Fixture.fixture.js
‚îú‚îÄ package.json
```

A global configuration can also be used for monorepo scenarios:

```
my-proj-a/
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îú‚îÄ bundle-size/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Fixture.fixture.js
‚îú‚îÄ package.json
my-proj-b/
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îú‚îÄ bundle-size/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Fixture.fixture.js
‚îú‚îÄ package.json
monosize.config.mjs
```

### Config API

```js
// monosize.config.mjs
import storageAdapter from 'monosize-storage-*';
import webpackBundler from 'monosize-bundler-webpack';

export default {
  repository: 'https://github.com/__ORG__/__REPOSITORY__',
  storage: storageAdapter(),
  bundler: webpackBundler(config => {
    // customize config here
    return config;
  }),
};
```

### Bundler adapters

To build fixtures and produce artifacts you need to use a bundler adapter. Following adapters are available:

- [`monosize-bundler-webpack`](https://github.com/microsoft/monosize/tree/main/packages/monosize-bundler-webpack)
- [`monosize-bundler-esbuild`](https://github.com/microsoft/monosize/tree/main/packages/monosize-bundler-esbuild)

### Storage adapters

To store reference results and run comparisons you need to use a storage adapter. Following adapters are available:

- [`monosize-storage-upstash`](https://github.com/microsoft/monosize/tree/main/packages/monosize-storage-upstash)

## Commands

### `measure`

```sh
monosize measure [--debug] [--quiet]
```

Builds fixtures and produces artifacts. For each fixture:

- `[fixture].fixture.js` - a modified fixture without a default export, used by a bundler
- `[fixture].output.js` - a fully minified file, used for measurements
- `[fixture].debug.js` - a partially minified file, useful for debugging (optional, if `--debug` is passed)

Produces a report file (`dist/bundle-size/monosize.json`) that is used by other steps.

### `compare-reports`

Compares local (requires call of `monosize measure` first) and remote results, provides output to CLI or to a Markdown file.

```sh
monosize compare-reports --branch=main --output=["cli"|"markdown"] --deltaFormat=["delta"|"percent"] [--quiet]
```

### `upload-report`

> Note: requires a configured storage adapter.

```sh
monosize upload-report --branch=main --commit-sha=HASH [--quiet]
```

Aggregates local results to a single report and uploads data to Azure Table Storage.

> Note: should be called only during CI builds.
